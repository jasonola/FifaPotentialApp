# FifaPotentialApp

This is a simple Shiny app built in the R programming language, showing potential of Fifa 23 players. You can see the general score and the potential of players. It is based on the Fifa data found on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/1898257a1915cbd22dd226f16c66dc218dfb65fd6f062755f4d0243bb8365a99?resource=download) data.
You can try it out [here](https://jasonola.shinyapps.io/FifaPotentialApp/)
